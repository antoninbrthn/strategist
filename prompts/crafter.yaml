  Crafter is an open-world survival game used as a reinforcement learning (RL) benchmark. The game focuses on evaluating an agent's general capabilities by presenting a procedurally generated, 2D environment where agents interact through visual inputs. Crafter is designed for deep exploration, long-term reasoning, and generalization, making it a rich environment for RL research.
  
  ### Environment Overview:
  - **World Generation**: Each episode takes place in a procedurally generated 64x64 grid world. Terrain types include:
    - **Grasslands**
    - **Forests**
    - **Lakes**
    - **Mountains**
    - **Caves**
  
    The terrain determines the distribution of creatures and resources. These elements are generated using OpenSimplex noise, ensuring smooth transitions between terrain types.
  
  ### Game Mechanics:
  1. **Survival Needs**:
     - **Health**: The player/agent has health points (HP), which are depleted by hunger, thirst, fatigue, or attacks from monsters. HP regenerate when hunger, thirst, and fatigue are satisfied.
     - **Hunger**: Decreases over time; satisfied by eating meat (from cows) or plants.
     - **Thirst**: Decreases over time; satisfied by drinking from lakes.
     - **Rest**: Decreases over time; replenished by sleeping in safe areas.
     - If any of these values (hunger, thirst, rest) reach zero, the player starts losing health.
  
  2. **Resources**:
     - Resources can be collected and used to craft tools. They include:
       - **Wood** (from trees)
       - **Stone**
       - **Coal**
       - **Iron**
       - **Diamonds**
       - **Saplings** (plants that can be grown for food)
     
  3. **Crafting and Technology Tree**:
     - Players can use a **crafting table** and a **furnace** to craft tools:
       - **Wood Pickaxe** and **Wood Sword**
       - **Stone Pickaxe** and **Stone Sword**
       - **Iron Pickaxe** and **Iron Sword**
     - Higher-tier tools like the iron pickaxe and sword require more advanced resources (iron, coal) and improve efficiency in collecting resources and defeating enemies.
  
  4. **Creatures**:
     - **Cows**: Source of meat (food).
     - **Zombies**: Appear in grasslands, especially at night.
     - **Skeletons**: Found in caves; they attack with arrows.
     - At night, zombie spawns increase, making it more dangerous for the agent.
  
  5. **Day-Night Cycle**:
     - **Night** increases the difficulty by reducing the agent's visibility and increasing zombie spawns. The agent needs to find shelter (like caves) to avoid nighttime dangers.
  
  6. **Achievements**:
     - The environment includes **22 achievements**, each representing a task the agent can complete, with many requiring specific dependencies to be fulfilled before they become accessible. 
       - Collect Wood
       - Place Table (requires: Collect Wood)
       - Make Wood Pickaxe (requires: Place Table)
       - Make Wood Sword (requires: Place Table)
       - Collect Stone (requires: Make Wood Pickaxe)
       - Place Stone (requires: Collect Stone)
       - Make Stone Pickaxe (requires: Collect Stone)
       - Make Stone Sword (requires: Collect Stone)
       - Collect Coal (requires: Make Stone Pickaxe)
       - Collect Iron (requires: Make Stone Pickaxe)
       - Place Furnace (requires: Collect Stone, Collect Wood)
       - Make Iron Pickaxe (requires: Collect Coal, Collect Iron, Place Furnace)
       - Make Iron Sword (requires: Collect Coal, Collect Iron, Place Furnace)
       - Collect Diamond (requires: Make Iron Pickaxe)
       - Collect Drink
       - Defeat Zombie
       - Defeat Skeleton
       - Eat Cow
       - Collect Sapling
       - Place Plant (requires: Collect Sapling)
       - Eat Plant (requires: Place Plant)
       - Wake Up
     - Each achievement can be unlocked during an episode, rewarding the agent with sparse rewards.
  
  ### Game Interface:
  - **Observation**: Agents receive 64x64 pixel images representing a top-down view of the world, including an 8x8 grid area surrounding the player and an inventory display (health, hunger, thirst, rest, collected materials).
  - **Action Space**: A flat categorical space with 17 actions, including movement, interacting with objects (e.g., gathering resources or attacking), crafting tools, and placing objects.
