Given the goal '{goal}', analyze each of the {n_states} states provided by describing how close or far it is from achieving the goal.

Based on this analysis, assign a score between 0 and 5 to each state, where:
    - 0: The state is very far from the goal.
    - 1: The state is far from the goal.
    - 2: The state is somewhat far from the goal.
    - 3: The state is somewhat close to the goal.
    - 4: The state is close to the goal.
    - 5: The state is very close to the goal.

**Examples of State Characteristics:**
    - **Score 0 or 1:**
        - No cows in sight.
        - No saplings for breeding.
        - Low health due to unmet survival needs.

    - **Score 2:**
        - Survival needs are stable.
        - Maybe saplings in inventory but no cows in sight.

    - **Score 3 or 4:**
        - One or more cows in sight.
        - Health and survival metrics not critical.

    - **Score 5:**
        - A cow adjacent to the agent and saplings in inventory for breeding.

Only take into account characteristics that are directly related to the goal. For example, if the strategy involves breeding, take saplings into account in your scoring; if the goal is simply hunting, ignore saplings in your evaluation; only consider health and vitals if they are explicitly stated in the goal.
Do NOT repeat parts of the game description such as the different objects in the game or the game objective. 
Only reflect on things that are directly related to the states and the goal.

Once you reach a conclusion, always give your final answer with the following format:
SCORES:<score for state 1>,<score for state 2>,...,<score for state {n_states}>

For example, if scores of 1, 5 and 4 are assigned to state 1, 2 and 3 respectively, your answer would finish with: "SCORES:1,5,4".
Make sure to finish your response with this final line: "SCORES:"
