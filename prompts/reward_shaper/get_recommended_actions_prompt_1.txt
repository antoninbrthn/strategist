Determine the best action to take in the current state that will make the most progress toward achieving the goal.

The available actions are:
1. noop - Do nothing
2. move_left - Move left
3. move_right - Move right
4. move_up - Move up
5. move_down - Move down
6. do - Interact with the object that is right in front of the player.
7. sleep - Sleep to restore energy
8. place_stone - Place a stone block
9. place_table - Place a crafting table
10. place_furnace - Place a furnace
11. place_plant - Place a plant/sapling
12. make_wood_pickaxe - Craft a wood pickaxe using a crafting table
13. make_stone_pickaxe - Craft a stone pickaxe using a crafting table
14. make_iron_pickaxe - Craft an iron pickaxe using a crafting table
15. make_wood_sword - Craft a wood sword using a crafting table
16. make_stone_sword - Craft a stone sword using a crafting table
17. make_iron_sword - Craft an iron sword using a crafting table

When determining the best action:
- Consider your current inventory items and their counts
- Consider your surroundings and what resources are available
- Consider your current health, hunger, thirst, and energy levels
- Prioritize actions that directly contribute to the goal
- Only recommend valid actions that can actually be executed in the current state

For example, if the goal is to collect cow meat:
- If a cow is visible but not adjacent, move toward it
- If no cows are visible, explore to find grassy areas where cows spawn
- If a cow is adjacent to you, use the 'do' action to attack it
- Consider breeding cows by gathering and feeding them saplings if available

Your response MUST be in this exact format: ACTION:action_name, where action_name is one of the following:
[noop, move_left, move_right, move_up, move_down, do, sleep, place_stone, place_table, place_furnace, place_plant, make_wood_pickaxe, make_stone_pickaxe, make_iron_pickaxe, make_wood_sword, make_stone_sword, make_iron_sword]
